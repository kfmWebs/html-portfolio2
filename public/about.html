<h1>Here's some more info About Me!</h1>
<p>
  Hey, I'm Kameela and I'm a recent graduate. 
  I have a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Finance 
  and although I love all things to do with Finance and Investing, 
  I have so many more interests, therefore I've decided to delve into the world
  of web development to help the small businesses out there.

  In this new age of technology and the internet, having a website as a business is a must! 
  Yes clients can be gained via word of mouth and paper flyers but 
  think about something we use every single day. The internet! 
  It takes 2 seconds for a simple google search to answer your questions. 
  <p>"Hey Google, I need a website building what shall I do?"</p>
  <p>"Sure thing! check out kfmWebs, here's her portfolio!"</p>
  It's that easy! 
</p>
<p>
  Local businesses are at the heart of what I do, every business deserves to have an online presence.
  A vast amount of companies have seen an increase in revenue just by having a public website. 
  It allows potential customers to gain insight into what a business has to offer.
</p>
<p>SO what are you waiting for? if you like what you see,
  head over to my contact page and drop me a message.
  I look forward to potentially helping another business grow and succeed.
